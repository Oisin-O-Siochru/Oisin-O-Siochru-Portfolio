# M.E.Thesis: Big Data Analytics at JD.com: Evaluation of linear, nonlinear, and hybrid time series forecasting models.
* Completed an ME thesis in the applications of big data analytics in demand forecasting methods for e-commerce and online retailing using real world data of over 2.5 million customers.
* Implemented fundamental data analytical techniques such as data preprocessing, manipulation and structuring and developed and trained statistical ARIMA, Machine Learning Neural Network, and Hybrid ARIMA-Artifical Neural Network models using the refined training datasets.
* Manipulated and cleaned datasets for demographic segregation prior to forecasting retail demand. 
* Presented relevant findings and business implications based on model metric evaluation.

# Personal Project 1: YELP API Dublin Pub Data Visualisation Project:
* Called and collected raw pub data from the greater Dublin area  using YELP Fusion API.
* Applied pre-processing steps (cleaning, filtering) to json data and parsed raw data to csv format.
* Presented summary statistics in pub review counts, ratings, and pricing ranges accross dublin both graphically and with mapping visualisation.

# Academic Project 1: Football API Data Visualisation Project: 
* Called and collected raw data from a public web football league API using Python and stored in JSON for subsequent analysis. 
* Applied pre-processing steps (cleaning, filtering & integration).
* Characterised and visualised with tables and graphic visualisations with various python packages for each step such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 
* Summarised insights gained from analysis of the datasets.

# Academic Project 2: Webscraping Text Classification Project:
* Scraped a corpus of news stories through parsing a set of web page HTML and extracting specific text information. 
* Applied appropriate pre-processing steps to create a numeric representation of the documents suitable to train
* Performance binary classification and multi-class classification using KNN classification and 5 fold cross validation to classify news stories catagories from the set of extracted articles. 
* Used various python packages such as scikit-learn, itertools, beautiful soup.
